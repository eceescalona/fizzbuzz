FizzBuzz exercise statement
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

To run the solution, you will need a C# compiler and interpreter like the one VisualStudio has. 
If you only want to run the xUnitTest solution you need do this steps:
--First you need to get into the directory that contain the test solution in this case ..\fizzbuzz\TestFizzBuzzExcercise\TestFizzBuzzExcercise.csproj.
--Second you need to get dotnet sdk library install and run this comand <donet test> in the comand line.

If you want to set a diferent set of records to test you need to copy a new file name test it need to be a text file o modify the exisitng file en the resource folder.
..\fizzbuzz\Resources\test.
Note: If not needed put the extension file in the name if you create a new one file.
