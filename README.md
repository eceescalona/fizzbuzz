FizzBuzz exercise statement
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

To run the solution, you will need a C# compiler and interpreter like the one VisualStudio has.

Recommended to use:
VisualStudio 19
.NET Core
